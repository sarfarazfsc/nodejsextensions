# Top 10 nodejs extensions 

1.Bracket Pair Colorizer : 
         Bracket Pair Colorizer 2 colorizes matching brackets, making it easier to visually 
         see which opening and closing brackets, braces, or parentheses belong to each other.

2.npm : 
         The npm extension provides two features: running npm scripts defined in the package.json 
         in the editor and validating the packages listed in the package.json.
        
3.npm Intellisense : 
         The npm Intellisense extension introduces autocomplete behavior when you use require() to import modules into your code.

4.ESLint :
         The ESLint extension uses your local ESLint and configured rules to look for common patterns and issues in JavaScript code,
          and is designed to help you write better code with fewer bugs. ESLint can also reformat your code to make it more consistent,
          depending on the rules you have enabled for your project. 

5.Code Spell Checker : 
          One nice thing is the extension understands camelCase, PascalCase, snake_case, and more. Another great feature is there are 
          dictionaries available for Spanish, French, German, Russian, and a number of other languages.

6.Auto Close Tag : 
          More recent versions of VS Code automatically create closing tags when you are working in an HTML or XML file. For other file types, 
          such as JavaScript, Vue, and JSX, Auto Close Tag will save you some typing!

7.DotENV : The DotENV extension for VS Code adds convenient syntax highlighting when editing a .env file.

8.Path Intellisense : The Path Intellisense extension adds autocomplete support for file paths and names, reducing typing as
                       well as the introduction of bugs related to wrong paths.

9.MarkdownLint : The Markdownlint extension can help you make sure your markdown syntax is in good form!

10.Material Icon Theme : The Material Icon Theme adds a ton of icons to VS Code for different file types. Being able to quickly 
                         distinguish different files in project can be a great time saver!
